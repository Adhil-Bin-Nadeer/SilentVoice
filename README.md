## About
SilentVoice bridges the communication gap for people who struggle with verbal expression due to speech impairments. Our mission is to give every individual a voice that is heard, respected, and understood, improving independence, engagement, and quality of life.

---

## Problem Statement
- Millions of people worldwide face speech or communication difficulties.
- Existing solutions are often expensive, not user-adapted, or impractical for caretakers and hospitals.
- There is a need for affordable, accessible tools that adapt to each user‚Äôs needs.

---

## Solution
SilentVoice converts blinks into clear voice outputs using AI, allowing non-verbal users to communicate effectively. The system is adapted for each user and designed for practical usage in hospitals, care centers, and at home.

---

## How It Works
1. **User Setup:** The user or caretaker sets up SilentVoice and calibrates the blink sensor for accurate detection.
2. **Adaptation:** SilentVoice creates a personalized communication profile, adapting to the user‚Äôs blink patterns and preferences.
3. **Communication:** The user blinks to select phrases or letters, which the system converts into voice output in real-time.
4. **Smart Room Control:** Specific blink patterns can also trigger smart room actions like turning lights or fans on/off.
5. **Feedback & Learning:** The AI tracks user interactions to suggest predictive phrases and improve response speed over time.
